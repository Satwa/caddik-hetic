# Caddik
## App made in Kotlin for an H2 exam

Caddik allows you to scan a product's barcode and get info about this specific product. It works for food-related stuff and beauty-related stuff too.

We rely on OpenFoodFacts and OpenBeautyFacts API for this project. Thanks to all the contributors for the awesome work.
